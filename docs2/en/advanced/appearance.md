# How to Customize Appearance and Style in jsMind

When creating mind maps using jsMind, customizing the appearance and style is crucial. By setting themes, custom themes, styles, node rendering methods, line rendering methods, and layout options, users can tailor their mind maps to meet their specific needs and aesthetic preferences. Here is a brief overview of these elements and their interrelationships.

## Themes & Custom Themes

jsMind offers 15 built-in themes that users can directly apply to quickly set the overall style of their mind maps. These themes cover a variety of colors and styles suitable for different use cases, helping users unify the appearance of their mind maps efficiently.

In addition to the built-in themes, users can create custom themes to suit their specific requirements. By adding style definitions in the `jsmind.css` file, users have full control over the colors, fonts, backgrounds, and other aspects of their mind maps.

## Custom Styles

Apart from setting overall themes, jsMind allows users to customize styles for individual nodes. Users can define properties such as background color, text color, width, height, font size, and more for each node.

## Custom Node Rendering

Custom node rendering methods enable users to completely control how nodes are displayed. By default, jsMind uses built-in rendering methods to generate the HTML structure of nodes. Custom node rendering methods allow users to define the HTML structure and styles of nodes according to their needs, achieving more complex and personalized node display effects.

## Custom Line Rendering

Similar to node rendering methods, users can also customize line rendering methods. The default line rendering method draws connections between nodes based on the theme and styles. With custom line rendering methods, users can change the color, style, thickness of lines, and even modify the shape of lines to achieve more personalized connection effects.
